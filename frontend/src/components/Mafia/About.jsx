                    Mafia is a strategic game best played by 8 people including a moderator but needs a minimum of 
                    6. There are two main goals to the game. To the mafia, the goal of the game is to eliminate the
                    other players such that the mafia outnumber the citizens. The mafia does this by choosing a player

                    them out and assist their community through the help of the doctor who can vote to grant a citizen
                    protection and the detective who can figure out the roles of other players. If you're ready to put
